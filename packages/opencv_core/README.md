# opencv_core

OpenCV for Flutter, if `highgui` or `videoio` is required, use [opencv_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/opencv_dart)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> OpenCV SDK (~100M) will be downloaded via `FetchContent` of cmake, you can
> set `DARTCV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable to cache it and avoid downloading it again.
> e.g., `export DARTCV_CACHE_DIR=$HOME/.cache/dartcv`

## Customizing OpenCV Modules

You can enable or disable specific OpenCV modules for your build by specifying them in your app's `pubspec.yaml` file under the `dartcv_modules` section. A Dart script will read this section and generate a `dartcv_modules.cmake` file, which is used by the build system.

### Example `pubspec.yaml` configuration

```yaml
dartcv_modules:
  exclude:
    - contrib
    - dnn
    - features2d
# or
# dartcv_modules:
#   include:
#     - core
#     - imgproc
```

- Use `exclude` to disable specific modules, or `include` to enable only specific modules.
- The Dart script will generate a `dartcv_modules.cmake` file in your app root before building.
- If neither is specified, all default modules will be enabled.

### iOS/macOS Module Selection

For iOS and macOS, module selection is handled via CocoaPods. In your `ios/Podfile` or `macos/Podfile`, specify only the modules you need:

```ruby
pod 'DartCvIOS/core', '4.11.0.2'
pod 'DartCvIOS/imgproc', '4.11.0.2'
# Add more as needed
```

- Only the modules you list will be included in your app.
- Make sure your Podfile matches your desired module configuration.

### Generating the CMake Config

After editing your `pubspec.yaml`, run:

```sh
dart tools/generate_dartcv_cmake.dart
```

This will generate a safe `dartcv_modules.cmake` file in your project root, which is used by the build system.  
**Do not edit this file by hand.**
